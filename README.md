# dvorak-de-type-II
Windows keyboard layouts made with Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator for the "Dvorak Typ II Deutsch" layout. 

## Disclaimer
I just did this for myself and if it helps you, great. Do with it whatever you like.<br>
But: I am not accepting contributions.<br>
I am not maintaining this other than what I need. <br>
I simply documented this so if I have to repeat the setup in about 5 years, I still know how it worked.<br>
And if it helps you on top of that: great! <br>
If you raise an issue in this repository asking for help, I might answer. But I don't expect anyone to need help.

## Modifications
I am writing a lot of markdown when documenting code. This requires a lot of backticks  `` ` ``. The default behavior for backticks is to function as a deadkey. 
Meaning that it is waiting for a second character to be typed and then constructing a composed character. For example, the combination `` `+a `` creates `Ã `.

I rarely use this, so I changed the default backtick key behavior to non-deadkey and added the deadkey on ``Alt Gr + Shift + ` ``.
Same goes for `^`.

In order to get the Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V etc to work again and with my new C key, I had to modify the `VK_` column of the source file.
These resources helped me understand and doing it:
